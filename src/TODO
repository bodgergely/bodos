Scheduling
==========

-   Multilevel scheduling based on priority first then round robin.
    We should have a priority queue of a lists.
    Each level represents a priority level and each level has a list
    of tasks with the same priority. On a given level the tasks
    are scheduled in a round robin fashion.

    Needed tools:
        - Data structure holding a pair of <priority level> + <list of pids>
        - Circular list where we hold the tasks for a given priority level.

    Requirements:
        - Fast lookup of the next to be scheduled task!

    Implementation:
        - priority_queue<class K, class V> to hold the <priority level> + <list of pids>
        - Each value in the priority_queue should be a queue<pid>.
